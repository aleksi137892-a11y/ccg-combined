## 1. Overview

### Mission Statement

The IIMG is a specialized citizen-led body of appeal established by the Civic Council of Georgia. We operate as a parallel body of appeal to international law and human rights, picking up the mantle of state responsibility where it has been vacated.

Our mission is the rigorous documentation of potential breaches of international law—specifically the deployment of chemical agents, systemic violence, and state-level financial crimes. We follow the Berkeley Protocol and other international standards to ensure that what you submit may be used when it matters most.

### Key Principles

- **Dignity**: Your wellbeing is as important as the evidence you provide
- **Security**: 256-bit encryption, end-to-end encrypted communications
- **Evidentiary Standards**: Berkeley Protocol compliance for court admissibility

### Legal Disclaimer

> This mechanism operates as a civic and documentary body. It does not replace courts, law enforcement, or regulatory authorities, nor does it adjudicate disputes or determine criminal or civil liability. All materials are provided in the public interest to preserve records, support lawful remedies, and prevent the erasure of harm where justice has been denied.

## 7. Tier 3: Digital Evidence (Berkeley Protocol)

### Step 1: Overview

**Title:** Digital evidence needs verification.

**Content:**  
Photos, videos, documents, and other digital files can be critical evidence—but only if their authenticity can be proven.

**Note:**  
We'll walk you through the process step by step.

---

### Step 2: Why Proper Preservation Matters

**Title:** Why proper preservation matters.

**Content:**  
Courts require proof that digital evidence hasn't been altered. The Berkeley Protocol provides international standards for this verification.

**Key Concepts:**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cryptographic Verification** | Creates a unique digital fingerprint (hash) that proves the file is authentic and unaltered. |
| **Timestamp & Location** | Embeds when and where the file was captured, creating an unalterable record. |
| **Chain of Custody** | Documents the complete handling history from capture to submission. |

**Medical Documentation Note:**  
Medical records, injury photos, and treatment documentation are critical evidence. Ensure dates, provider names, and patient identifiers are visible. Photograph documents in good lighting without flash.

**Link:** Read the Berkeley Protocol →

---

### Step 3: Submission Options

**Title:** Choose your submission method.

**Option 1: Save App (Berkeley Protocol Compliant)** ✓ Recommended  
The only method that provides full cryptographic verification for court admissibility.

**Option 2: Tresorit Encrypted Upload**

Physical items—clothing, objects, documents—can be critical evidence. How you handle them now affects their legal value later.

**Safety Warning:**

> **Your safety comes first.**  
> If you suspect chemical contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, do not handle items directly. Contact us first.

---

### Step 2: Contact Us Soon

**Title:** Please contact us as soon as you're able.

**Content:**  
Physical evidence handling is extremely delicate. We need to coordinate with you directly to establish a secure chain of custody and provide guidance specific to your situation.

**Action:** Screenshot or save these contacts now.

---

### Step 3: Preservation Guidelines

**Title:** In the meantime, a few preservation tips.

**Subtitle:**  
Until we can coordinate directly, follow these guidelines to protect evidentiary integrity.

#### Document in Real Time with Save App

If possible, use the Save app to photograph evidence in place before touching or moving it. Include a scale reference (coin, ruler) and capture the surrounding area. Contact us immediately if you need guidance.

#### Preservation by Material Type

| Material | Guidelines |
|----------|------------|
| **Clothing & Fabric** | Place in a clean paper bag—not plastic. Do not wash, clean, or shake off debris. Label with date, time, and location if possible. |
| **Liquid Samples** | Use a glass container with an airtight lid. Store upright in a cool, dark place. Refrigerate if possible—do not freeze. |
| **Documents & Paper** | Handle by edges only. Place in a clean folder or envelope. Store flat in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight. |
| **General Storage** | Keep all items away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and humidity. A cool, dark closet or drawer is ideal. Do not give items to anyone else until we coordinate. |

---

### Step 4: Photograph with Save App

**Title:** Please photograph what you have.

**Content:**  
Using the Save app to photograph evidence in your possession is the most forensically rigorous approach. The app embeds cryptographic verification automatically.

**Photography Guidelines:**
- Include a reference object for scale (coin, ruler, pen)
- Capture multiple angles
- Document any visible damage or markings
- Keep location services enabled

**Action:** Continue to Save App →
